LDVELH (Livre dont vous êtes le héros) generator

What I want this project to be:
- a simple WYSIWYG (more or less) editor for creating LDVELHs easily
- an interface to play to the created LDVELH(s)

To do:
- find how to say LDVELH in English in order to have a proper documentation ><
- decide on a means to store data (database structure)
- find my old CSS "old book style" project
